    The confusion centers on whether it is appropriate for a client to always
    automatically issue a follow-up GET request to the URI in response's
    Location header, regardless of the original request's method. For the
    record, the intent of 302 is that this automatic redirect behavior only
    applies if the client's original request used either the GET or HEAD
    method.
    To clear things up, HTTP 1.1 introduced status codes 303 ("See Other")

    client the URI of a response resource. This can be the URI of a temporary
    status message, or the URI to some already existing, more permanent,
    resource.
    Generally speaking, the 303 status code allows a REST API to send a

    HTTP/1.1 introduced the 307 status code to reiterate the originally
    intended semantics of the 302 ("Found") status code. A 307 response
    indicates that the REST API is not going to process the client's request.
    Instead, the client should resubmit the request to the URI specified by
    the response message's Location header.
    A REST API can use this status code to assign a temporary URI to the

    case of insufficient client credentials; that would be 401 ("Unauthorized").
    REST APIs use 403 to enforce application-level permissions. For example, a
    client may be authorized to interact with some, but not all of a REST API's

    The API responds with a 405 error to indicate that the client tried to use
    an HTTP method that the resource does not allow. For instance, a read-only
    resource could support only GET and HEAD, while a controller resource might
    allow GET and POST, but not PUT or DELETE.

    header. For example, a client request for data formatted as application/xml
